    <p><b>For over 40 years,</b>For over 40 years, the Cole family has hosted their annual Harlem block party on East 130 Street and Madison Avenue. Hosting the party is a tradition that has been passed down from generations of men in the family. Over 200 neighbors and friends attend annually and everyone, if not most tenants on the block, know about the celebration. But this year, the first 311 noise complaint was filed and the cops showed up. Allen Cole, one of the organizers of the block party said he is certain it was a new white neighbor on the block who made the complaint.

    <blockquote>“Because they're white they think they can come change the culture that’s not going to happen,” Cole said.</blockquote>

<p>Cole believes white folks move in to predominantly low-income communities without understanding the culture that the community already has. District leader Cordell Cleare believes there is culture clash for white people who come from middle class neighborhoods and move into low-income neighborhoods. She says some newcomers have the option of vacationing in the Hamptons to get together with friends and family, but for people who live in low-income neighborhoods, block parties are their Hampton trip.</p>

<p>“There are people who the culture of the neighborhood is very new to them,” said Cleare. “I think they respond out of ignorance. They don’t know the history. Some people don’t do “outside” on their block, partly because maybe they have options.”
</p>

<p>An <a href="https://www.gimletmedia.com/science-vs/gentrification-whats-really-happening#episode-player">analysis</a> of 600,000 calls to 311 conducted by host of Science Vs podcast, Dr. Meryl Horn, states people in New York City are complaining more about their neighbors’ noise in gentrifying neighborhoods compared to other neighborhoods.</p>

<p>The 311 data doesn’t show whether a gentrifier or longtime resident made the complaint, but Rory Kramer, a professor of sociology at Villanova University in Philadelphia who studies gentrifying neighborhoods told Horn, “I’ll put it really bluntly: I don’t think long time predominantly minority residents call police to their neighborhood nearly as often for things like noise complaints as new white neighbors.”</p>

<p>Her analysis, however, excluded the 10037 zip code, a small area In East Harlem, where <a href="https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9/data">311 street/sidewalk noise complaints have increased</a> since 2013. The neighborhood in which the a noise complaint was made about the annual E 130th street block party.</p>
