<p> NY City News Service Reporter Katherine Hernandez took a closer look at where street/sidewalk 311 noise loud music noise complaints have been reported in the 10037 zip code area of East Harlem in the past eight years. The interactive map below showcases the date and location of the reported noise complaints. Check out how many noise complaints have been made on your block in the past few years.</p>

<p>The once predominantly African-American community has gone through changes in its demographics in the past few years. Host of Science Vs podcast, Dr. Meryl Horn analysis of 600,000 calls to 311 shows people in New York City are complaining more about their neighbors’ noise in gentrifying neighborhoods compared to other neighborhoods.</p>

<p>The 311 data doesn’t show whether a gentrifier or longtime resident made the complaint, but Rory Kramer, a professor of sociology at Villanova University in Philadelphia who studies gentrifying neighborhoods told Horn, “I’ll put it really bluntly: I don’t think long time predominantly minority residents call police to their neighborhood nearly as often for things like noise complaints as new white neighbors.”</p>
