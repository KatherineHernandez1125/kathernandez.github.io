    <p><b>For over 40 years,</b> the Cole family has hosted their annual Harlem block party on East 130 Street and Madison Avenue, a tradition passed down from generations of men in the family.Over 200 neighbors and friends attend annually and everyone, if not most tenants on the block, knows about the celebration. But this year, the first 311 noise complaint was filed and the cops showed up. Allen Cole, one of the organizers of the block party said he is certain is was a new white neighbor on the block who made the complaint.</p>

    <blockquote> “Because they're white they think they can come change the culture that’s not going to happen,” he said. </blockquote>

  <p><i>A journalism graduate student sorted through NYC Open Data 311 Complaints to find all the residential/street noise complaints made on East 130 Street and Madison Avenue since 2013. The student was trying to find out whether there has been an uptick in noise complaints the past few years.</i></p>

    <p>Allen Cole is not only one in the community that believes white folks move in to predominantly low-income communities without understanding the culture that the community already has. District leader Cordell Cleare believes there is culture clash for white people who come from middle class neighborhoods and move into low-income neighborhoods.</p>


    <p>She said some people have the option of vacationing in the Hamptons to get together with friends and family, but for residents of low-income neighborhoods block parties is their Hampton trip.</p>

   <blockquote>“There are people who the culture of the neighborhood is very new to them,” said Cleare. “I think they respond out of ignorance. They don’t know the history. Some people don’t do “outside” on their block, partly because maybe they have options.”</blockquote>
