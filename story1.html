<p> Ex Vandals artwork below the L Train Atlantic Av Subway Platform</p>

<p>Almost every weekend, under the elevated L Train Atlantic Av subway platform in East New York, you can hear the shaking of spray paint cans and deep house music playing. Street writing crew EX Vandals are hard at work painting the walls surrounding a lot owned by World Contracting Inc. For over three years, the crew has aspired to beautify the hood and give street writers of all ages a space to showcase their work.</p>
