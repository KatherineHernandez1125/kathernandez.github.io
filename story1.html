<p>Street writer <a href="https://www.facebook.com/koolkito.exvandals">Kool Kito</a> picked up his first can of spray paint before the internet existed. “We were sending messages, but on trains from Brooklyn to the Bronx back to Harlem and so on,” he said. </p>

<p>At 12 years old Kool Kito was making a name for himself in the street-writing scene and was recruited by the  <a href="http://www.at149st.com/xvandals.html">EX VANDALS</a>, one of most-known writing crews in New York City since the 70s. The crew was initiated by students from Brooklyn's Erasmus Hall High School, Dino Nod and Wicked Gary. Kool Kito,59, grew up in East Flatbush and says a lot of young writers saw painting as an alternative to the gang scene of the 80s.</p>

<p> “You don’t need to go to a psychiatrist. All you have to do is grab a can of paint and hit that wall that’s like therapy,” said Kool Kito. For over 47 years, he spilled his art on walls any day of the week, but now only writes on the weekends.</p>

<p> On any given Sunday morning you can catch him on the border of East New York and Brownsville, under the elevated L Train Atlantic Avenue station, with a cigarette in his left hand and spray can in the other. He is commonly joined by EX VANDALS members Will Power, Fred "Ree" Vilomar, and CEA. Old-school funk and house music can be heard coming from a boombox while they work.</p>

<p> The walls surrounding a trucking company lot, co-owned by Jose Sencha, gets a fresh coat of paint, also known as buffing, most weekends. The EX VANDALS refresh the walls all year round so new writers, who want to paint legally, can have a blank canvas. Writers from across the global such as MOPZ, well-known in Amsterdam, have visited East New York for the first time to vibe and paint with the crew. Will Power says hundreds have painted on the walls since the crew first began the project “Under the L Train” in 2015. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><font color="white"><font size="5">“We do this to give back to the neighborhood,”
  said Will Power. “Art always brings life to the neighborhood.”</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p> The students at Trey Whitfield Elementary School, across the street, have taken notice of the artwork. “Every year, you come and you see it, so it’s kind of lets you know, okay, you’re back in school. It kinda makes you happy,” said six-grader Janay Clarke, who always looks forward to what the EX VANDALS might paint next.</p>

<p> “The mural across the street is very inspirational,” said eighth-grader Jasmyn Brunner.</p>

<p> Principal A.B. Whitfield says it’s the first time he’s ever seen street art like the EX VANDALS’s in the community. “It’s an asset to the neighborhood. I think every neighborhood should embrace that,” said Whitfield, who hopes to collaborate with the crew on future projects. </p>

<p> The EX VANDALS aspire to expand the project further down Atlantic Avenue with the support of the community. “If they gave me the China wall, I would go over there and paint there too,” said Kool Kito.</p>

<p>Almost every weekend, under the elevated L Train Atlantic Av subway platform in East New York, you can hear the shaking of spray paint cans and deep house music playing.</p>
